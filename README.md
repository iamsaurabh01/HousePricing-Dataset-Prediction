# HousePricing-Dataset-Prediction
machine learning prediction model
It is a very simple dataset but one thing to be noticed in this dataset is that,
the prices of the houses are based on the locations only but as we know practically,
the price increses as the area-size increases so a very simple modification has been done while preparing the model.
